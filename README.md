# Cryptomator extension for iOS Files

uses [Cryptomator](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-objc-cryptor) obj-c library.

Feel free build this and run, I have no intentions to release an app from this. 

## Caveat
Looks like iOS imposes a memory limit (15MB) for extensions. Keep an eye. It certainly works in simulator. I might get this into a separate app instead of Files extensions.
